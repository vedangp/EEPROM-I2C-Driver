all the three tasks are in their respective folders. All the folders contain a makefile which can be used to build the drivers as well as  the test applications. In the first two tasks, the application will write 2 pages to the EEPROM. For the third task, the application will ask you how many pages to write.

to compile any of the task just run "make" to clean up, just run clean. Following is the description of files and running instruction of each tasks.

task1:	
	file			significance
	eeprom_operations.c	contains EEPROM_write, EEPROM_read, EEPROM_seek operations.     
	eeprom_test.c		test file for above operations.
	eeprom_test		the executable for running
	Makefile		makefile to compile and clean up. 

task2 and task3: (the name of files are same in both the folders.)
	file			significance	
	i2c-flash.c		contains the driver.
	i2c-flash_test.c	contains the test application.
	i2c-flash-test		executable for test application.
	i2c-flash.ko		kernel module for the driver.
	Makefile		to build and clean all the files. 

Note: for task2 and task3 you may have to change KDIR to your kernel source tree. The default path is the one used by virtual machines in lab.
